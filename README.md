### **🏆 Project : Handwritten Numbers Recognition**

- **📌 Description:**  
  This project shows **images of handwritten numbers after user input** (first version).  
  There is only one version available:
  - 🇬🇧 **English version**: Includes English commentary (`-en`).

- **🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Customtkinter.  
- **⏳ Time to complete:** Don't remember since I had to take a break from it.

⚠️ Reminder: This is a beginner-level project — a test, an exploration, a digital sketchbook.  
⚠️ Note: This app might take a few seconds to load because of the model being trained before you can use it.

### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **sixth project**, and for a beginning, I'm proud of it! 🎉  
- It took me a lot of days to make the prediction function works at first.  
- Then, it was just drawing the canvas on the application and review some measures of the Frames.

It was a great learning experience, especially for my review of **Scikit-learn**, **class and function** and **models with pipelines and KNN**.

💡 My strengths: Determination, self-taught mindset and a lot creativity.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Code and visualization optimization.

### **💭 Possible Remake of that LEVEL:**  
I’m planning a future remake with:
- The handwritten number recognition from real pictures
- Better GUI (background, etc...)
- Maybe extending it to letters and not only numbers
- And lots of possible features, such as multiple languages for the menu.

"More advanced versions will come soon... Stay tuned."
